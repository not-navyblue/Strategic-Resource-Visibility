# Strategic Resource Visibility
Also known as SRV, this is a lightweight UnCiv cheat mod that immediately reveals all strategic resources on game start.

Fair warning: Like UnHax, as SRV is a cheat mod, it is advised that you use it at own risk and ruin your 
experience by yourself. Hey, don't blame me for it when it is ruined, you downloaded this mod after all lol

### Recommendation/s
SRV is best used with [UnHax](https://github.com/not-navyblue/UnHax) for the maximum UnCiv hax.

## What the mod contains
All strategic resources' visibility are no longer bound by their respective technologies.
