# Strategic Resource Visibility
Also known as SRV, this is a lightweight UnCiv cheat mod that immediately reveals all strategic resources on game start.

Fair warning: Like UnHax, as SRV is a cheat mod, it is advised that you use it at own risk and ruin your 
experience by yourself. Hey, don't blame me for it when it is ruined, you downloaded this mod after all lol

### Recommendation/s
SRV is best used with [UnHax](https://github.com/not-navyblue/UnHax) for the maximum UnCiv hax.

## What the mod contains
All strategic resources' visibility are no longer bound by their respective technologies.

## Changelog
### v1.0 (November 10, 2021 Update)
*Initial Release*
#### Major Changes
- Removed tech limitations of all strategics<br>

P.S. I have no use for a CHANGELOG.md with this mod unless if there's a valid reason, which hopefully there isn't.

- Mod inspired by... um... I don't know exactly... I guess this mod is a novel idea?
